# How Will Stock Markets ‘Weather’ Climate Change?

Capitalism and industrial processes are often associated as one of the culprits of climate change, but what is often left unnoticed is the fact that this very phenomenon may impact economies and stock market indexes (for the better or the worse). This is because real life events can have a severe impact on stock market fluctuations as these events can have a direct impact on the future of many stocks and this, in turn leads consumers to respond to these predictions (1). Our goal is to understand how companies and countries
contribute to climate change, measured by annual highest temperature, by looking at factors such as their stock market indexes as well as fossil fuel consumption.

Research Question:
How are stock market indexes of companies and countries affected by initiatives made to tackle climate change, indicated by fossil fuel consumption?

How do companies and countries contribute to climate change as indicated by their stock market indexes and fossil fuel consumption, respectively?

We plan to categorise nations into three groups:

1. High Stake: Countries that are highly impacted by climate change and hence have a stake in working towards reducing emissions, characterised by a decrease in fossil fuel consumption.
2. Medium Stake: Countries that do not necessarily have immediate danger from climate change, but do have the resources to bring out change and thus their fossil fuel consumption is fairly steady.
3. Low Stake: Countries that have little to no incentive towards reducing the impact of climate change and their fossil fuel consumption is increasing.

In a similar vein, we shall identify companies from our chosen countries that belong to one of the following criteria:

1. Green Companies: Firms that are developing products that have a direct / significant role in reducing emission levels.
2. White Companies: Companies that do not have a direct impact on climate change, either by working to produce greener alternatives or by directly impacting emission levels.
3. Red Companies: Firms that profit from the sale of fossil fuels or release high levels of green gas emission in their production processes.

It is important to understand the situations and ideologies of nations and corporations and hence the reasons for their approach towards climate change. By doing so, it will be possible to plan out effective strategies to ensure that economic and environmental interests are secured in our bid to improve the worsening state of global climates. This project shall assess relevant data, as well as produce a model to analyze the trends in stock market indices of nations and firms to better understand their role in combating climate change.
